- Step 1: Open Bloxstrap.
- Step 2: Run Built.Exe, this will implement the json in the fastflags section of Bloxstrap.
- Step 3: Once you ran the application, head to the fastflags section in Bloxstrap and hit save. Done!

Benefits:
  - Reduces input lag significantly.
  - Boosts performance (FPS).
  - Removes material textures (You can toggle this off in Bloxstrap if you do not like it).
  - Updates with Roblox, so no need to run it everytime Roblox updates.
  - If it can, prevents Roblox from crashing.

Will be active and updating this project till September or October.
